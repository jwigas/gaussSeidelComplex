Gauss Seidel Numerical Iteration for Complex Number

This xlsx file was made in order to solve complex equation (2+3i)x + 3x + (2-i)x = 2+i
using numerical gauss-seidel iteration

Theres no lines of codes, only several logical step.
I would not make the tutorial because it is pretty easy to guess how it works.
